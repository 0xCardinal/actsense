# Trusted Action Publishers Configuration
# 
# This file defines which GitHub Action publishers are considered "trusted".
# Actions from trusted publishers won't trigger warnings when secrets are passed to them.
#
# To add a new trusted publisher:
#   1. Add the publisher prefix (e.g., "your-org/") to the trusted_publishers list below
#   2. Restart the application
#
# Format:
#   - Use the publisher prefix (owner name) followed by a slash
#   - Example: "actions/" means all actions from the "actions" organization are trusted
#   - Example: "elgohr/" means all actions from the "elgohr" user/org are trusted
#
# Note: The check uses prefix matching, so "actions/" will match:
#   - actions/checkout@v3
#   - actions/setup-node@v2
#   - actions/cache@v3
#   etc.

trusted_publishers:
  # GitHub Official Actions
  - "actions/"              # GitHub official actions (actions/checkout, actions/setup-node, etc.)
