# Artipacked Vulnerability

## Vulnerability Description


Artifact upload without explicit retention policy may store sensitive data indefinitely.
This increases the risk of data exposure over time.


## Recommendation


Set explicit retention-days to limit artifact storage time:


1. Add retention-days to upload-artifact:

- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4

with:

path: dist/

retention-days: 30  # Set appropriate retention


2. Review retention requirements:

- Set retention based on business needs

- Consider compliance requirements

- Ensure artifacts are deleted when no longer needed


3. Review all artifact uploads in workflows
