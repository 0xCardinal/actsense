# Inconsistent Action Version

## Vulnerability Description


Action {action_name} is used with {len(versions_list

## Recommendation


Standardize on a single version of {action_name} across all workflows:


1. Identify the latest stable version:

- Visit: https://github.com/{action_name}/releases

- Review the changelog for the latest stable release

- Check for security fixes and improvements


2. Update all workflows to use the same version:

- Review all {len(all_workflows
